Use when you want to capture a reusable sequence of device interactions for later replay.
Returns { message, flowFile, savedTo } and optionally { previousFlow } if a prior recording was abandoned.
Fails if the .argent/flows/ directory cannot be created or the flow file cannot be written.

After starting, use flow-add-step to append tool calls — each step is executed
LIVE and then recorded unless the tool throws. Inspect each returned result
before continuing; remove or replace recorded steps whose result reports a
non-throwing failure. Use flow-add-echo to add labels. Call
flow-finish-recording when done.

If a recorded step turns out to be wrong, you can edit the .yaml file directly
to remove or reorder steps.`,
