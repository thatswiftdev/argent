Each step is executed in order: tool calls are dispatched through the registry,
echo steps print a message. A tool step may carry \`delayMs: <ms>\` to sleep
that long before the step runs. Returns the result of every step, including images.
Use when you want to replay a recorded flow or run a scripted sequence of device actions.
Fails if the flow file does not exist or a step tool raises an error (execution stops at that step).
An \`await-ui-element\` step whose condition is not met before its timeout also stops the flow there
(its later steps were recorded assuming the condition held), so use one to gate a step on a screen transition.
A \`find\` step that returns \`{ found: false }\` also stops the flow there, so replay never silently
continues after a missed locate-and-act step — except a \`find\` with \`action: "exists"\`, whose
\`found: false\` is a valid "not present" answer that lets replay continue.

set to true, the tool returns a notice with the prerequisite instead of running.
